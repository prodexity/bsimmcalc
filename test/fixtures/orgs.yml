# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

org_one: {name: "Organization A"}
# column: value
#
org_two: {name: "Organization B"}
# column: value
